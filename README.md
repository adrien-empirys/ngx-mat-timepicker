A simple time picker module using Angular Material: it provides an Android style dialog for time selection and a handy input for time selection in Material style.

### Why this project?
The original was nice, but for some reason it didn't adapt to your Material theme.
So an extra config was necessary to have a nice integration in your app.
This project **automatically adapts** to your Material theme, even if a custom one (so, for example, if you have a dark theme, you'll have a dark dialog!).
By default it will use the primary color.
You can choose the color scheme among the three **ThemePalette** items, natively provided by Material: `primary`, `accent`, `warn`.

Also a few components were unnecessary and not in material style, so I got rid of them and integrated Material components, such as `mat-select` and others.

**Other general improvements**
* Improved clock hand alignments
* Changed clock hand appearance for minutes which aren't multiple of 5 (as in Android timepicker)
* Improved appearance of focused inputs, the toggle and increase/decrease arrows in timepicker-field
* Improved header content disposition when 24h format is enabled
* Used material buttons for dialog actions (CANCEL/OK)
* Added leading zero for the hours in the dialog header (as in Android timepicker)
* More consistent naming
* Removed useless exports from NgxMatTimepickerModule

### Compatibility

* v9 < Angular/Material < v13


**IMPORTANT**
Remember to include a Material Theme in your project, example:

`@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";`

Refer to the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) website for theming options.

## Getting started

Install timepicker through npm:
```bash
npm i --save ngx-mat-timepicker
```
Next import the timepicker module into your app's module:
```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {NgxMatTimepickerModule} from 'ngx-mat-timepicker';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxMatTimepickerModule]
})
export class MyModule {}
```
Finally connect the timepicker to an input via a template property:
```angular2html
<input [ngxMatTimepicker]="picker">
<ngx-mat-timepicker #picker></ngx-mat-timepicker>
```
The timepicker opens once you click on the input

## Internationalization
Timepicker supports locales in format `BCP 47`. It has `en-US` locale by default.

To override default locale:
```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {NgxMatTimepickerModule} from 'ngx-mat-timepicker';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxMatTimepickerModule.setLocale('en-GB')]
})
export class MyModule {}
```

This service allows to **change the locale anytime**.
You can inject this in your component or extend and provide your version, in order to provide your current locale to all the pickers!
